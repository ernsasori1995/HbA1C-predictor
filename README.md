Introduction :
The following project uses data sets from two previously published studies to
characterize cardiovascular risk factors in central Virginia for African-Americans (courtesy of Dr.
John Schorling, University of Virginia School of Medicine).
The first study was a community-based study on the prevalence of coronary heart disease risk
factors among rural blacks. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of coronary
heart disease (CHD) risk factors among a population-based sample of 403 rural blacks in Virginia.
Rural blacks were the subjects of this study as CHD is the most common cause of mortality among
blacks due to higher rates of CHD risk factors among them.
The second study was a trial of church-based smoking cessation interventions for rural African
Americans. This was done to address the health problems of African Americans in two rural
counties in Virginia. To target smoking behavior, a smoking cessation program was designed
and implemented by church groups. This program combined one-on-one counseling with two
counselors, self-help materials, and community-wide activities. To measure the
effectiveness of the intervention, respondents were recontacted after 18 months through a door-to-door survey to evaluate smoking cessation, stages of change, and exposure to the intervention.

Objective
Diabetes Mellitus (DM) Type II is strongly associated with obesity and hypertension. The waist-to-hip ratio may be a predictor of both diabetes and heart disease. Glycosylated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) > 7.0 is usually taken as a positive diagnosis of diabetes
The primary objective of this project is to characterize the relationship between BMI and
Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C). The secondary objective is to understand other clinical factors that
may impact the relationship between BMI and HbA1C.
